## Downloading and Installing R ##
 Go to https://www.r-project.org/
 
 On the left side of the page,you will find CRAN.
 This stands for Comprehensive R Archive Network, and it allows selection of a regional computer network from which you can download R.
 Choose the location nearest to you. 
 
 Clicking the Linux, MacOS X, or Windows link opens the window that allows us to choose between the base installation file and contributed packages. We discuss packages later. For the first time, click on the link labelled base.
 
 After the installation is over, you will have a console and a terminal. Console is like a interpretor where you can perform simple arithmetic and basic operations.
 
 **Editor:**
 For editor use  Tinn-R. Go to https://tinn-r.soft112.com/ and download. And you can use RWindEdt (this is an R package).
